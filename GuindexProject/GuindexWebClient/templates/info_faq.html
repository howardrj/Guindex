                            A: Yes, this allows the personal contributions of each user to be tracked, tallied and associated with their account.
                            We also feel that requiring users to sign up for the site encourages responsible use of the submission capabilities.

                                <li>
                                    Adding new pubs to the database.

                        </i>

                            Q: How do I submit the price and rating of a pint in a particular pub?
                        </b>

                    <li>
                         <i>
                            A: To submit the price and rating of a pint of Guinness go to the side bar (desktop) or dropdown (mobile),
                            open up the data tab and click on <a class="page_content_link" data-content_page_id="data_table_page"><b>table</b></a>.
                            This will open a table of all the existing pubs in the Guindex database.
                            You can then search for the desired pub in the search field at the top of the table,
                            enter the observed price of Guinness at that pub and the star rating you wish to assign that pint and click on the submit button.

                        <b>
                            Q: The pub I'm trying to submit for already has a price and star rating, what should I do?
                        </b>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                         <i>
                            A: That's okay, you can submit anyway!
                            We want the site to have the most recent price, even if the price hasn't changed it is good to know that this is the case.
                            We also store the historical prices that have been submitted for each pub 
                            and will hopefully be able to look at the time evolution of Guinness pricing as time goes on. The star ratings of the pints at each pub come from averaging each submission for that pub. As such it is helpful to have as many ratings for each pub as possible so as to have a fuller, more robust idea of the quality of the offering.

                            Q: The pub I'm looking to add a price for isn't in the database, how can I add it?

                        <i>
                            A: Before adding a pub make sure to check the data table and also browse to the location of the pub
                            on the <a class="page_content_link" data-content_page_id="map_page"><b>map</b></a> tab in order to ensure the pub isn't already in the database.
                            It's especially important to check the map as sometimes pubs appear in the table with odd, outdated, misspelled or just totally wrong names.
                            If the pub is indeed not in the database then you can go to the <a class="page_content_link" data-content_page_id="data_add_pub_page"><b>add a pub</b></a> tab on the data dropdown of the menus.
                            Once on this page you should fill in the form specifying the name and county of the new pub and then click on the location of the pub using the mini-map.
                            When these fields have been completed you can click submit to add this pub to the database.

                        <b>
                            Q: What do you consider to be a pub?
                        </b>

                        <i>
                            A: We have decided (completely arbitrarily) the criteria for a pub; it must serve pints,
                            be open to the public, have regular hours and in the cases where there is a cover charge further pinting should be the primary motivation to paying that charge.
                            So for those reasons hotel bars are in, as are sports club bars provided they don't require club memberships.
                            Bars at concert venues are out, as are those at sporting events.

                            Q: A pub already in the database is incorrectly named or is in the wrong location, can I amend this?

                            A: In the right most column of the table page there is an option to open an edit pub form.
                            By clicking on this option you can enter and submit the necessary changes.

                            A: When non-staff members submit a new price and rating or a new pub to the Guindex this submission goes to a holding stage where it gets reviewed by a staff member. This review process is to ensure that the submission is legitimate, formatted correctly and, in the case of new pub submissions, doesn't represent a duplicate submission.
