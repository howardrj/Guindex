               Dublin Pintscape in a Warmer World

		   Over the coming years we will see worsening global disruptions due to the escalating climate crisis. These disruptions consist of, among others, wildfires, droughts, deluges and emergent, fast-amplifying hurricanes.                  
                </p>

                <p>
              	    AlongÂ with these extreme weather events we will also see continuing insistent sea-level rise as the environment responds to our noxious effluvia. Just this week (I'm writing this on 30/10/2019) a research study suggested that by 2050 300 million peoples homes will flood at least once a year due to rising sea-levels and storm surges.
                </p>

                <p>
             	    Sea-level rise poses an existential threat, especially for inhabitants of coral atoll nations and other low-lying populations. In Dublin, barring significant global mitigation efforts or suitable local adaptation measures, sea-level rise will also re-shape our terrain. In this article we examine what these changes will mean for the pinting ladscape of central Dublin.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b> Emissions Scenarios </b>
                </p>

                <p>
             	    We will consider two separate scenarios of different amounts of total greenhouse gas pollution. The first scenario, which worryingly looks increasingly fanciful, is that we collectively manage to abide with the Paris agreement and keep global temperature rise to 1.5&#8451; above pre-industrial levels. The second scenario considers the effect of continuing on the current emissions trajectory which will bring us 4&#8451; of temperature rise.
                </p>

             	<p>
                    As the rate at which we are emitting greenhouse gases is so high we are collectively forcing the ecological systems to such a degree that they cannot instantaneously respond. Instead they will require a certain time to elapse before the full effect of our cumulative emissions to date is observed. To conduct this analysis we shall use the surging seas mapping choices tool which is found at <a href="https://choices.climatecentral.org/">climatecentral</a>. This tool uses a combination of SRTM data from NASA for elevation and peer-reviewed scientific research for the sea-level rise projections. The analysis considers Dublin following the long-term relaxation of the environment following the last emissions to lock-in each of the scenarios considered (and no more emissions beyond that point). It is likely that this relaxation will take anywhere from a couple of hundred to a couple of thousand years.   
                </p>

                <p>
		   Dublin's pintscape under the first emissions scenario, where we collectively limit global heating to 1.5&#8451;, is displayed in the above figure. We see that, even in this scenario, there are large swathes of Poolbeg, Ringsend, Irishtown, Sandymount, East Wall and the Docklands under water. Some of these areas are reclaimed land so it is not terribly surprising that these areas will be some of the first affected by rising sea-levels.                     
                </p>
		
		<p>
		In total around 20 pubs in the displayed areas will be in the sea under this scenario. Dublin's lowest lying pub is the boat, the M.V. Cill Airne, which is uniquely adapted to survive the rising seas. The Strand House on North Strand Road will eventually live up to its name, however the Yacht pub and the Oarsman pub, both in Ringsend, will need to better reflect their own to survive the changing environment.

                </p>
		<p>
		Under the second emissions scenario, where emissions continue on the current trajectory, global heating will be 4&#8451;. The resulting Dublin pintscape under this scenario is displayed in the above figure. We see that, in this scenario, the coastline has made further incursions into the city. Nearly all of the north inner city which is east of Marlborough street is now underwater. The green luas line, if it still exists, will travel along the coast for a significant portion of its journey through the city centre. In the south inner city practically all of Dublin which is east of Tara street is now submerged. Further west we see that large patches of Smithfield will be greedily lapped up by the waves and that the sea will consume Heuston station also. Outside of the inner city we see that the coastline now goes through Ballybough, Baggot Street and Ballsbridge.  
		</p>

		<p>
		In this more troubling scenario around 90 of Dublin's current pubs in the areas displayed, rather than being in the drink business, will simply be in the drink. The Pavillion bar in Trinity College Dublin will now be by the sea-side, as will Becky Morgans on Grand Canal Street, the Hill 16 pub on Gardiner Street, the 51 on Haddington Road, The Cobblestone's in Smithfield and Arthur Mayne's in Donnybrook. Much-loved bars such as Mulligans on Poolbeg Street and Ryan's in Beggars Bush will be lost. Do we want to pass on a world where lovely Mulligan's pints of Guinness may no longer be available?
